# What Developers Should Learn Next: A 2019 Roadmap

## Mandatory for All
As you can see, there are certain technologies one should be aware of irrespective of whether you are a backend or a front-end developer. These are:

- Data Structures and Algorithms: One of the most important aspects that many developers seem to ignore, but for sure are the area one should not ignore at all!
- Basic Terminal Commands: This is also an important aspect, but it can be improved alongside your other learnings. These commands are not limited to the use of vi, cat, ps.
- Version Control (GIT): You MUST be aware of the workflow of git and its basic aspects like namespace, branches, tags, merge and all.

## Skills:
This section contains the skills a software engineer should learn and these may obviously vary according to one's situation:

- At least one backend framework: You need to be very well versed with at least one backend framework. It may be Laravel/Symphony, Spring, etc., depending on the technology you are working in.
- At least one front-end framework: Similarly, you need to be very well versed with at least one front-end framework. It may be Angular (my personal favorite), React.js, Vue.js, or something like that.
- NoSQL databases: This is in huge demand and you have to have a hands-on NoSQL DB like MongoDB. However, you should also be absolutely comfortable with MySQL-like databases and concepts like joins.
- A caching engine: Actually, hitting the database again and again for searching similar kinds of data is a huge overhead on servers, and hence having hands-on experience with at least one caching engine like Redis or Aerospike is a great add on nowadays.
- A Search Engine: In today's world, searching for queries in databases is frequent and often adds huge overhead to servers, especially when the quantity of data is huge. To tackle that, companies are shifting to search engines like Elasticsearch which tackle these problems amazingly.
- Communication skills: This is point is often neglected by techies nowadays but often proves to be a deal breaker: one should hone their communication skills gradually with time.
- Read tech blogs: Reading tech blogs like dev.to, FullStackGeek, and DZone will certainly help you gather knowledge about latest tech updates.
